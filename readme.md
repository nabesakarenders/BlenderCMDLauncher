# Blender CMD Launcher

A small portable application to launcher Blender in 'headless' mode for rendering single frames or animations without the overhead of the viewport.


## Installation

Grab from the releases page and place somewhere memorable. The app is portable and so does not install. It will place a small `ini` file next to the application after first launch to remember your chosen Blender path.

## Known Issues

- The time remaining can get a little confused after rendering completes and can repeat the "Time Remaining" prefix
    
## Roadmap

- UI Cleanup and pretty-fication
- May be useful for more of the options to be remembered, instead of just the default Blender EXE path
- Warnings about options that cannot be specified from the UI and are taken from the Blend File
- More soonâ„¢
