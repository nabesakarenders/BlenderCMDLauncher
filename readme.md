# Blender CMD Launcher

A small portable application to launcher Blender in 'headless' mode for rendering single frames or animations without the overhead of the viewport.


## Installation

Grab from the releases page and place somewhere memorable. The app is portable and so does not install. It will place a small `ini` file next to the application after first launch to remember your chosen Blender path.
    
## Roadmap

- UI Cleanup and pretty-fication

- More soonâ„¢
