# Blender CMD Launcher

A small portable application to launcher Blender in 'headless' mode for rendering single frames or animations without the overhead of the viewport.

## IMPORTANT

The exe is currently being flagged by some anti-virus programs (like Windows Defender) because... I have no idea. The app is literally just a single python file and PyQt6. Probably PyInstaller being flagged because reasons. Either trust it or don't, I'll do what I can to resolve the false positives when I have time.

## Installation

Grab from the releases page and place somewhere memorable. The app is portable and so does not install. It will place a small `ini` file next to the application after first launch to remember your chosen Blender path.

## Known Issues

- The time remaining can get a little confused after rendering completes and can repeat the "Time Remaining" prefix
    
## Roadmap

- UI Cleanup and pretty-fication
- May be useful for more of the options to be remembered, instead of just the default Blender EXE path
- Warnings about options that cannot be specified from the UI and are taken from the Blend File
- More soonâ„¢
